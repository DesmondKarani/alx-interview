# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation

## Overview
This project focuses on validating whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. You will use your understanding of bitwise operations, the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming to accomplish this task.

## Concepts Needed
### Bitwise Operations in Python
- Understanding how to manipulate bits using operations like AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), and bit shifts (<<, >>).
- **Resource:** [Python Bitwise Operators](https://realpython.com/python-bitwise-operators/)

### UTF-8 Encoding Scheme
- Familiarity with UTF-8 encoding rules and how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.
- Understanding the patterns that represent valid UTF-8 encoded characters.
- **Resources:**
  - [UTF-8 Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
  - [Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html)
  - [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html)

### Data Representation
- How to represent and work with data at the byte level.
- Handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.

### List Manipulation in Python
- Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.
- **Resource:** [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

### Boolean Logic
- Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program.

## Requirements
- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Environment:** All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- **File Standards:**
  - All files should end with a new line.
  - The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
  - Your code should follow the PEP 8 style guide (version 1.7.x).
  - All files must be executable.

## Additional Resource
- **Mock Technical Interview:** Practice your skills by simulating a technical interview focused on these concepts.

By studying these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be well-equipped to complete the UTF-8 validation project, effectively using bitwise operations and logical reasoning to determine the validity of UTF-8 encoded data.
