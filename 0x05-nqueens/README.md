# N Queens Problem

## Description

The N Queens problem is a classic algorithmic challenge that involves placing N non-attacking queens on an N√óN chessboard. This project implements a solution using the backtracking algorithm in Python.

## Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

```bash
./0-nqueens.py N
```

where `N` is the size of the chessboard (must be an integer greater than or equal to 4).

## Example

```bash
./0-nqueens.py 4
```

Output:
```
[[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 2]]
[[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 1]]
```

## Files

- `0-nqueens.py`: Main program file that contains the implementation of the N Queens solution.

## Requirements

- Python 3.4.3 or higher
- The program should be executed in an environment with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
